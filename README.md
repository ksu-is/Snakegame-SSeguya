# Snakegame-SSeguya
A classic that everyone loves...no matter the age!

My goal is to see if I can add more colors to the snake game and see if I can make the frame bigger for the snake to travel. 
Also, I want to see if I can add additional features to the game, like maybe uploading data from a previous game try or something like that. Additional features could also include a pause/unpause function, different gamemodes, and co-op/multiplayer capabilities.

Reseraching different tutorials should help with this project. Getting my ideas on paper in always a good thing!
